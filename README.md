# DigitalNoticeBoardManager
The goal of the project is to provide a centralized digital noticeboard system that helps students easily access important university notifications without missing them.
In many universities, notices are scattered across WhatsApp groups, emails, or informal channels, which increases the risk of missing critical information such as scholarships, class updates, deadlines, or official announcements. This application solves that problem by organizing all notices in one place.
